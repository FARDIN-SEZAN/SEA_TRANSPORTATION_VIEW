Project Title: SEA TRANSPORTATION
This is just a self-made project for my "Computer Graphics" course. It took 13 days to complete the project. The project includes a total of 4 scene transitions. Below is a description of various Mouse/Keyboard interactions in different phases of the project:

i )   Pressing 1, 2, 3, or 4 will trigger a scene transition ; <br>
ii )  Each scene has a Day/Night function. Pressing the L|R mouse button will switch between Day and Night ; <br>
iii ) In Scene 3, Double pressing "A" will increase the ship's speed  and  Pressing "W" will stop the ship. L|R mouse button will switch between Day and Night ;<br>
iv ) In Scene 4, The Day/Night function is available. L|R mouse button will switch between Day and Night. Pressing "Q" will stop the car. Pressing "E" will resume the<br>  carâ€™s movement  ;<br>




Description: 
The project showcases the transportation system through ships, illustrating the journey of a vessel carrying loaded containers across the sea.
The scenario begins at a bustling port, where the ship is prepared for departure. As the journey commences, the ship sets sail, navigating through vast open waters. Along its voyage, it passes through various locations, each offering unique landscapes and distinct environments. The ship glides past coastal towns, towering cliffs each presenting a different scene and atmosphere.
Throughout its expedition, the ship encounters the rhythmic rise and fall of ocean waves, and the lively movement of other vessels sharing the same waters. Eventually, after traversing great distances, the ship reaches its final destination, marking the successful completion of its journey.
Overall, this project beautifully illustrates the intricacies of the sea transportation system, highlighting the dynamic and ever-changing nature of maritime travel.
